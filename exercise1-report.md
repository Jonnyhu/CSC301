## Individual Deliverables ##

* Good - My team decided to start on the project early, and chose a data structure that i was unfamiliar with (Collection, DataQueues). But later once I learned how they work and funtion, I can see using this made the entire project easier.

* Bad - My team started early, and we relied each member's ability to understand and read code. This slowed progression a bit. I believe a code review session where we ask each other questions about peice we wrote would speed up progression more.

* I enjoyed working with all of them. I a lot of communication was done using github, and everything is listed and tickets are submitted and marked clearly.
